# :toolbox: `nparsy` - `scanf` but faster, leaner, and more versatile for your numerical parsing needs
Given a string, parse out numbers into a single return value or a list (array).

Instead of an all-in-one function like `scanf`, this "library" has its functions split out into separate library files as well as combined into a single library file if desired by the downstream user. Compared to `scanf`, this library aims to:

1. be as fast as possible,
2. be easier to use for the case where you don't want to care about format; just give me the numbers you find
3. support more robust error handling for the user (functions return an enumerated constant for the error type)
