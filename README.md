# :toolbox: `parsy` - `scanf`, but lean
Given a string, parse out numbers into a single return value or a list (array).   

Instead of an all-in-one function like `scanf`, this "library" has its functions split out into separate library files as well as combined into a single library file if desired by the downstream user. Compared to `scanf`, this library aims to:

1. be as fast as possible,
2. be easier to use (no format specifiers, just pass in the string and a pointer to an object to be written to as the return value).
3. support more robust error handling for the user (functions return an enumerated constant for the error type)
