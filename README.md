# :toolbox: `nparsy` - `scanf` but faster, safer, and more versatile for your numerical parsing needs
Given a string, parse out numbers into a single return value or a list (array).

Compared to `scanf`, this library aims to:

1. be as fast as possible,
2. be easier to use for the case where you don't want to care about format - just give me the numbers you find!
3. support more robust error handling for the user (functions return an enumerated constant for the error type)
4. try to be as safe as possible to use
5. split out the main functions into separate translation units so as to produce a leaner library for the end-user
